	abstract = {Operation of interior permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM) at the maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) operating point requires knowledge of the exact values of machine parameters such as the inductances and back-EMF constant, which depend on saturation and temperature variations. On-line estimation of the machine parameters may not be suitable for practical applications due to the requirement of intensive computation. The objective of this paper is to present a simple MTPA operating point tracking control strategy for vector controlled PMSM drives with slow dynamic loads. The proposed method searches for the MTPA operating point by modulating the current phase angle and observing the variation in the power command. The current angle modulation strategy is designed to sense the influence of load variations in the power command. Therefore, the proposed method can track the MTPA operating point of the PMSM independent of load variations. Experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {The work presented in this paper addresses the unwanted windup phenomenon reviewing and comparing different PI anti-windup strategies employed in speed control of electric drives. The tuning process of PI controllers is usually carried out considering the system as linear and therefore disregarding its physical limits such as maximum current and voltage. To safeguard the system's integrity, the PI output is normally limited eventually causing the windup phenomenon characterized by long periods of overshoots which may even result in instability.Firstly, this paper models and tunes the current and speed PI controllers with the root locus method for field oriented control of a permanent magnet synchronous machines. Secondly, it is shown the mentioned unwanted windup phenomenon in the speed loop. Finally, the anti-windup strategies are simulated and their behavior are compared when driving a permanent magnet synchronous machine with field oriented control. Finally, some experimental results obtained from a PMSM matrix converter-fed set up have been carried out. These results corroborate the mathematical study and simulations presented all over this paper.},

Initially, a brief state of the art regarding linear permanent-magnet generators and MLSs is given, leading to an introduction of the MLS and a presentation of the results from a finite-element analysis used to find the magnetic forces. Furthermore, the force per magnet surface area measure is presented as a better alternative to the force density measure, which is often used for linear magnetic devices. Based on this, the overall design of a 500-kN MLS is presented focusing on the bearing supports used to compensate for the magnetic attraction forces and the resulting deflection of the rotor. In addition, in order to avoid some of the assembling-related disadvantages of using surface-mounted magnets, an embedded-magnet topology is proposed. To demonstrate the technology, a scaled 17-kN MLS is presented together with experimental results.},

By measuring the DC-bus voltage and the phase currents, a systematic rotor position estimator has been developed. Finally, the rotor position and rotor speed are obtained, and a closed-loop control system can be achieved. A digital signal processor, TMS 320F2812, is used to execute the estimating algorithm and control algorithm. As a result, the hardware is very simple. Several experimental results show that both the position control system and the adjustable speed control system are achieved. The system can be adjusted from 1 to 2000 r/min. In addition, by using the proposed position-loop H ?? controller, the position control system can be achieved with satisfactory performance. This study proposes a new method for a sensorless interior PMSM control system.},

The proposed method is easy to implement, resulting in low computation burden. No filters are needed for extracting the high-frequency current signals for position estimation. The use of low-pass filters (LPFs) in the current control loop to obtain the fundamental current component is not necessary. Therefore, the control bandwidth of the inner current control loop may not need to be sacrificed. The proposed method may also be further developed to inject two opposite voltage vectors to reduce the effects of inverter voltage error on the position estimation accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by comparing with other sensorless control method. Theoretical analysis and experimental results are given for validating the proposed new sensorless control method.},

The average position estimation error is investigated based on the analysis of phase harmonic inductances, and deduced in the form of the phase shift of the second-order harmonic inductances to derive its relationship with the magnetic field distortion. Position estimation errors caused by higher order harmonic inductances and voltage harmonics generated by the SVPWM are also discussed. Both simulations and experiments are carried out based on a commercial PMSM to verify the superiority of the proposed method and the investigations in this paper.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a low-time-consuming and low-cost sensorless-control algorithm for high-dynamic performance permanent-magnet synchronous motors, both surface and internal permanent-magnet mounted for position and speed estimation, is introduced, discussed, and experimentally validated. This control algorithm is based on the estimation of rotor speed and angular position starting from the back electromotive force space-vector determination without voltage sensors by using the reference voltages given by the current controllers instead of the actual ones. This choice obviously introduces some errors that must be vanished by means of a compensating function. The novelties of the proposed estimation algorithm are the position-estimation equation and the process of compensation of the inverter phase lag that also suggests the final mathematical form of the estimation. The mathematical structure of the estimation guarantees a high degree of robustness against parameter variation as shown by the sensitivity analysis reported in this paper. Experimental verifications of the proposed sensorless-control system have been made with the aid of a flexible test bench for brushless motor electrical drives. The test results presented in this paper show the validity of the proposed low-cost sensorless-control algorithm and, above all, underline the high dynamic performances of the sensorless-control system also with a reduced equipment.},
